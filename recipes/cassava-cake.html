    <img src="../img/cassava-cake.jpg" alt="Cassava Cake">
    <p>Cassava Cake is a classic Filipino dessert made from grated cassava (manioc).  Cassava is also known as  kamoteng kahoy and balinghoy in the Philippines. Cassava starch is also used to make tapioca. There are different cassava cake around, but this Cassava Cake Recipe is by far, the best that I have had.</p>
    <p>This cassava cake recipe is my personal favorite. It is not until the time when I came here in the US that I was able to try the best cassava cake. I wish that  was exaggerating, but I am not. This cassava cake recipe is really great because it tastes good, it is rich, and very easy to prepare. The credit goes to our good friend, Sharon, who was kind enough to share her cassava cake recipe to us. So I asked for her permission to share the recipe with you, and she agreed. So here we are now with this Cassava Cake Recipe for everyone's enjoyment.</p>
