    <p class="recipe-description">Almost every region in the Philippines have their own pork adobo version. Sometimes, there can be more than one version in a location.</p>
    <p class="recipe-description">This is one of the favorite when it comes to family picnics. This is a dish wherein pork and chicken slices are combined and cooked inadobo style. It can be done the same way as this recipe, with or without onions. This is our clans signature summer dish in the Philippines. I remember my tito's and tita's prepare a large portion every summer outing. We would go to Pansol in Laguna to rent a swimming pool for the clan and they would bring with them two large cauldrons (kaldero). One has the adobo in it, while the other is for the rice.</p>
